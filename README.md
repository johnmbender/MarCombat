# MarCombat
A game, to conquer the world.

# TO DO, IN ORDER:
- turn off music (or something else) for Ledge conversation scene
- turn off music for FUGUM fight


- Cartoony filter not great; still could work, tho; use the cartoon PS tutorial to make the whole game more cartoony for fun, as an option
    - also, 8bit the music or use different music; could bitcrush everything
- full storymode test with music crossovers and Terje/Kelsie animations vs. FUGUM
- test all ambiences in convo scene
    - ambience in fights, too? if so, put them in game_controller
- John's hitbox went wonky (as AI)
- lose at Ox, intro music doesn't play (or isn't up)
- ai vs. ai highlights issues with AI; need to solve
    - bots sometimes don't attack - ATTACK is left on somehow?? - maybe reset when timer resets, but timer isn't resetting
    - bots too easy; also, maybe make them increasingly harder
- Terje's barbeque animation
- if Kelsie's special gets interrupted, hair is lying on the field - FIXED?
- fight music loop is bad
- sounds from people like: Kelsie: "owwwwwuh", etc

1: tweaks
2: Tyler - add before self-doubt with "why are you here?" and/or "I don't like you" OR after self-doubt asking what was that about, weirdo? (fight)
    - should throw bugs or something relevant
3: Julie
4: Local Multiplayer
5: Multiplayer

# IDEAS HEAP
- conversation scene:
    - need one where player says "Hey!" and the opponent says "I don't like you" and they both go into fight pose, just because


# Littler To-Dos:
- visually enhance Terje's special animation

# POLISH
- bug fixes and testing

# PRIORITY BUG FIXES
