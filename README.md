# MarCombat
A game, to conquer the world.

# TO DO, IN ORDER:
- FIGHT SCENE
    - fight music lowers at "X WINS"
    - John's self-doubt still has negasmoke after defeat on floor
    - CHECK: play random sound during fight
    - CHECK: cooldown indicator removed if fight over
    - CHECK: if bot blocks on attack that drops health at or below 0, they freeze rather than collapse
    - CHECK: randomize bot traits a little bit - I think it's fine
- OX
    - CHECK: rooftop ambience should stay on throughout Ox
- FUGUM

- Terje bot did not collapse after my 2nd win when hit, not fatality'd, but kelsie did?
- sometimes a hit leaves a bot at 0 health (?) and they don't collapse - one more hit and they collapse, and then collapse again
- hitting a bot mid-special tends to stick 'em
- after fatality (win) doesn't do victory
    - John v self-doubt, after fatality, I kept idling after the pointing
- sometimes the last line by FUGUM isn't spoken
- fade out the ambience at end of FUGUM fight

- Kelsie bot did three specials in a row :/
* sometimes the AIvAI they'll stand just out of each others reach and punch and kick the air
    - CHECK, but still might need to close the gap more, and not uppercut unless closer
- if you get too close to an AI it doesn't know what to do
    - CHECK (added a function to move back if that close)
        - if back is to wall, though...? uppercut I guess will free them


- AI issues:
    - Terje (others?) get locked in block animation until hit
        - also, sometimes happens at end of fight and no collapse animation
    - John's cooldown sometimes doesn't reset?
    - Kelsie's never gets dizzy
    - TOO difficult! :) - lower block, lower wait_time on timer, etc..
- CONTINUE available after every loss
- story continues currently even after loss!
- John's bullets need to do more damage with that long C
- Terje's special needs improvement, but also a check, because it's OP
- no Pete on office stage in story mode
- music on Ox fight is too loud? or just the R&B one in particular
- turn off music (or something else) for Ledge conversation scene
- turn off music for FUGUM fight


- Cartoony filter not great; still could work, tho; use the cartoon PS tutorial to make the whole game more cartoony for fun, as an option
    - also, 8bit the music or use different music; could bitcrush everything
- full storymode test with music crossovers and Terje/Kelsie animations vs. FUGUM
- John's hitbox went wonky (as AI)
- lose at Ox, intro music doesn't play (or isn't up)
- ai vs. ai highlights issues with AI; need to solve
    - bots sometimes don't attack - ATTACK is left on somehow?? - maybe reset when timer resets, but timer isn't resetting
    - bots too easy; also, maybe make them increasingly harder
- Terje's barbeque animation???
- if Kelsie's special gets interrupted, hair is lying on the field - FIXED?

2: Tyler - add before self-doubt with "why are you here?" and/or "I don't like you" OR after self-doubt asking what was that about, weirdo? (fight)
    - should throw bugs or something relevant
3: Julie
4: Local Multiplayer
5: Multiplayer

# IDEAS HEAP
- conversation scene:
    - need one where player says "Hey!" and the opponent says "I don't like you" and they both go into fight pose, just because
