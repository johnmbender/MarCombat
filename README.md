# MarCombat
A game, to conquer the world.

# TO DO, IN ORDER:
- Kelsie all messed up vs FUGUM
- did change to storymode music between a fight
- Johnm's hitbox went wonky (as AI)
- lose at Ox, intro music doesn't play (or isn't up)
- weird cross-music things between scenes
- ai vs. ai highlights issues with AI; need to solve
- Terje's barbeque animation
- continue -> launch, music doesn't start
- John's self doubt smoke not gone while on ground
- if Kelsie's special gets interrupted, hair is lying on the field
- bots sometimes don't attack - ATTACK is left on somehow?? - maybe reset when timer resets, but timer isn't resetting
- NegaSmoke remains after Kelsie (only?) is fatality'd
- bots too easy; also, maybe make them increasingly harder
- fight music loop is bad
- sounds from people like: Kelsie: "owwwwwuh", etc
- Kelsie vs. Kelsie, on bootality: (muffled) I like your boots!
- Terje vs. Terje, on fatality: ?

5: Multiplayer

# IDEAS HEAP
- conversation scene:
    - need one where player says "Hey!" and the opponent says "I don't like you" and they both go into fight pose, just because


# Littler To-Dos:
- visually enhance Terje's special animation

# POLISH
- bug fixes and testing

# PRIORITY BUG FIXES
