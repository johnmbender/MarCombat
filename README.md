# Known Bugs
Ox Anna fight:
    - collapses properly on first hit, incorrectly thereafter
    - issue where someone can get punched while flying from an uppercut - feature?

FIGHT SCENE
    - CHECK: if bot blocks on attack that drops health at or below 0, they freeze rather than collapse
    - CHECK: sometimes a hit leaves a bot at 0 health (?) and they don't collapse - one more hit and they collapse, and then collapse again
    - when John shoots bullets just as Terje has thrown his brochures, terje gets shot forever

AI:
    - Terje bot did not collapse after my 2nd win when hit, not fatality'd, but kelsie did?
    - hitting a bot mid-special tends to stick 'em
    - after fatality (win) doesn't do victory
    - Kelsie bot did three specials in a row :/
    - Terje (others?) get locked in block animation until hit
    - Kelsie's never gets dizzy

TERJE:
    - NEED: Terje's barbeque animation???


# IDEAS HEAP
- conversation scene:
    - need one where player says "Hey!" and the opponent says "I don't like you" and they both go into fight pose, just because
